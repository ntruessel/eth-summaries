\section{Priority Inheritance Protocol}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tasks have both nominal priority $P_i$ and active priority $p_i \geq P_i$.
		The tasks are sorted by nominal priority, highest first.
	\item Tasks are scheduled by their active priority using FCFS for ties.
	\item When $J_i$ is blocked, it transmits its active priority $p_i$ to the
		blocking task, $p_k = p_i$
	\item When $J_k$ exits the critical section, the highest priority job
		blocked by $J_k$ is awakened. If no other jobs are blocked by $J_k$,
		$p_k$ is set to $P_k$ otherwise to the highest priority of the jobs
		blocked by $J_k$.
	\item Priority inheritance is transitive.
\end{itemize}

Tasks have fixed priority (i.e.\,the kernel is not allwed to decrease the
priority of a task below $p_i$).
