\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $J = \set{j_1, j_2, \dots, j_n}$ is a set of tasks.
	\item $a_i$ or $r_i$ is the arrival / release time of task $i$.
	\item $d_i$ is the deadline of task $i$.
	\item $C_i$ is the total computation time of task $i$.
	\item $c_i(t)$ is the the remaining execution time of task $i$ at time $t$.
	\item $s_i$ is the start time of task $i$.
	\item $f_i$ is the finish time of task $i$.
	\item $L_i = f_i - d_i$ is the lateness of task $i$.
	\item $E_i = \max\left(0, L_i\right)$ is the exceeding time or tardyness of task $i$.
	\item $X_i = d_i - a_i - C_i$ is the laxity or slack of task $i$.
	\item $w_i = s_i - a_i$ is the waiting time of task $i$.
	\item $R_i = f_i - a_i$ is the response time of task $i$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{EDD}
Schedule the tasks in order of non-decreasing deadlines. This minimizes the
maximal lateness.

\subsection{EDF}
Always execute the task with the earliest absolute deadline.
Schedulability test:
\begin{equation*}
	\forall i \in [n] . t + \sum_{k = 1}^{i} c_k(t) \leq d_i
\end{equation*}

\subsection{LDF}
Among all tasks without successors select the task with the latest deadline. Put
it in a stack. Repeat until no more tasks. Now execute tasks as they are on the
stack.

\subsection{EDF*}
Modify arrival and deadline of each task and use EDF on modified tasks.
\begin{align*}
	r_j^* &= \max_{j}\left(r_j, \max_{i}\left(r_i^* + C_i | J_i \to J_j\right)\right) \\
	d_i^* &= \min_{i}\left(d_i, \min_{j}\left(d_j^* - C_j | J_i \to J_j\right)\right)
\end{align*}
