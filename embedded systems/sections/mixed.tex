\section{Mixed Task Sets}
A simple solution would be to schedule asynchronous tasks/events whenever there
is time available. However this might lead to starvation.

\subsection{Polling Server (RM)}
A polling server is an additional periodic task which is used to serve aperiodic
requests. An aperiodic task is schedulable if (sufficient but not necessary):
\begin{equation*}
	\left(1 + \ceil{\frac{C_a}{C_s}}\right)T_s \leq D_a
\end{equation*}
Where $C_a, C_s, D_a, T_s$ are the total computation time of the aperiodic
request, the computation time of one server task, the deadline of the aperiodic
request, and the period of the server task. It is assumed that one aperiodic
request is served before another task arrives.

When no task is available and the server has highest priority, the server looses
its timeslot to the other tasks.

\subsection{Total Bandwidth Server (EDF)}
A certain cpu utilization (bandwidth) is reserved for the server.  When the
$k$th aperiodic request arrives it receives the deadline
\begin{equation*}
	d_k = \max\left( r_k, d_{k-1} \right) + \frac{C_k}{U_s}
\end{equation*}
where $C_k$ is the total execution time of the request and $U_s$ is the
utilization factor of the server. The request is then treated as a normal
periodic task.

The schedule is feasible iff $U_p + U_s \leq 1$. Where $U_p$ is the processor
utilitation of the periodic tasks.
